## Description
Ripple is a web app that serves as a platform for:
* Community members to easily discover local businesses, discover real-time updates on safety measures being taken in response to COVID-19, and learn about the faces behind each business
* Local businesses to share personal stories and relevant information about their work in the community while growing their customer base virtually.

## Motivation
* Small businesses have experienced significant financial strain due to COVID-19.
* Many small businesses lack a strong online presence and struggle to maintain connections with customers
* Customers are unsure whether it is safe to order from a restaurant
* Traditional business-finding sites like Yelp are impersonal and too broad
* There is no centralized platform for discovering and interacting with local businesses, sharing business stories, and posting health safety updates
