# Ripple

Ripple is a web app that serves as a platform for:
    - Community members to easily discover local businesses, find real-time updates on safety measures being taken in response to COVID-19, and learn about the faces behind each business
    - Local businesses to share personal stories and relevant information about their work in the community while growing their customer base virtually.


Why Ripple?
    - Small businesses have taken a large financial hit due to COVID-19 
    - Many small businesses lack a strong online presence and struggle to maintain connections with customers
    - Customers are unsure whether it is safe to order from a restaurant
    - Traditional business-finding sites like Yelp are impersonal and too broad
    - There is no centralized platform for discovering and interacting with local businesses, sharing business stories, and posting health safety updates
